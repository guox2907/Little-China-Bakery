The Ancient Chinese people worshipped the harvest moon in Autumn. They believe the practice would bring good harvests the following year. The practice was originally popular only among the ruling class. However, in the Tang dynasty, the practice of celebrating the moon also became popular among the common people and has been celebrated ever since.

The tradition of eating Mooncakes began in the Yuan Dynasty (1279-1368). The Mooncakes are named after the Moon Goddess, Chang’e, who is said to make this kind of cake. They represent prosperity and reunion for the whole family, one cake is commonly shared several people in a family. Now a day’s people gift mooncakes to family and friends to express love and good wishes. The price to buy a mooncake can vary greatly from less than a dollar to more than $40 each. The cost is dependent on flavor and packaging, certain mooncakes can even be purchased as a luxury gift. The most expensive mooncake costs $1200 Canadian dollars.
